\section{Installation}
As noted earlier, spockjs is compatible with most modern JavaScript test runners
--- it is \textit{not} a test runner by itself,
which sets it apart from the Spock Framework.
Instead, spockjs ships in the form of a plugin for the popular JavaScript compiler Babel,
\autocite{Babel}
which can be set up to work with most modern test runners.
\autocite{BabelSetupDoc}
We will look at how spockjs uses Babel to implement assertion blocks later in the chapter.
