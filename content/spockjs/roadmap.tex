\section{Roadmap}
Spockjs has a lot of potential for additional features in the form of new block types.
Conceivable enhancements are
\begin{itemize}
  \item a block to perform the common task of asserting deep equality on objects and arrays,
    e.g. \code{expect: deepEq: a, b;},
  \item a block to assert that the statements inside it throw an error,
    e.g. \code{expect: throws: fn();},
  \item a block to capture a snapshot of a value, given that the test runner supports snapshot testing,
    e.g. \code{snapshot: a;}, and
  \item combinations of those,
    e.g. \code{snapshot: throws: fn();} to assert that an error is thrown and capture a snapshot of it.
\end{itemize}

The largest upcoming enhancement is the interaction testing capabilities
similar to the original Spock Framework.
We will lay the foundation for those in the next chapter.
