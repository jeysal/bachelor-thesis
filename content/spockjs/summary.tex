\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we looked at both the concept and
the rough implementation of spockjs assertion blocks.
We learned some of the basics of Babel plugins along the way.
The part that is not specific to assertion blocks,
but applies to blocks in general,
can be reused for implementing interaction blocks.
The architecture of spockjs will allow us to do this
without touching any of the packages that are only responsible
for the existing assertion block transformation.

To get the whole picture, we also learned
how to install and configure spockjs for a project,
and what features might be coming up next,
one of which is the interaction testing capabilities
we will deal with in the next chapter.
