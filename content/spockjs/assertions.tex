\section{Assertion blocks}
Assertion blocks are the only feature of the original Spock Framework
that spockjs has implemented so far.
A simple assertion can be realized using spockjs
in the same way it would look using the original Spock:
\autocite{SpockjsGithub}
\begin{minted}{javascript}
expect: 'a' + 'b' === 'ab';
\end{minted}
In ESTree terms, this is a \textit{LabeledStatement}
with an \textit{Identifier} named \textit{'expect'} as its \textit{label}
and an \textit{ExpressionStatement} as its body,
containing the strict equality \textit{BinaryExpression}.

Unlike Spock, to write an assertion block with multiple assertions in spockjs,
the \textit{ExpressionStatement}s must be wrapped in a \textit{BlockStatement}:
\autocite{SpockjsGithub}
\begin{minted}{javascript}
expect: {
  'a' + 'b' === 'ab';
  1 < 2;
}
\end{minted}
This allows users to continue with ordinary statements after an assertion block
instead of implicitly assuming that everything in a test case
that comes after a label is an assertion.
It also fits the representation in the AST better,
since all assertions are children in the \textit{body} of the
\textit{LabeledStatement} that represents the assertion block
instead of its following siblings inside
the surrounding method body or other \textit{BlockStatement}.
In consequence, we also avoid a weird formatting style
of the assertion block that an automatic formatter might otherwise produce:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
expect:
  'a' + 'b' === 'ab';
1 < 2;
// or
expect: 'a' + 'b' === 'ab';
1 < 2;
\end{minted}

Using the alternative \textit{when-then-style}
for code with side effects is supported as well,
with \code{when} and \code{expect} blocks
being treated in exactly the same way:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
when: {
  abc.setXyz(1);
}

then: {
  abc.getXyz() === 1;
}
\end{minted}
The \code{when} block does not have any special meaning here,
its only purpose is to improve readability of the test case
but could in theory be replaced with just its contents.
\autocite{SpockjsGithub}

Using statements other than \textit{ExpressionStatements}
and \textit{BlockStatements} consisting of \textit{ExpressionStatements}
--- such as control structures ---
in an assertion block is not permitted.
For instance, the following code would not compile with spockjs:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
expect: {
  if (x < 1) x === 0.5;
  else x === 2;
}
\end{minted}
However, assertion blocks can be nested into other structures,
so the desired behavior from this example can be achieved in the following way:
\autocite{SpockjsGithub}
\begin{minted}{javascript}
if (x < 1) expect: x === 0.5;
else expect: x === 2;
\end{minted}
