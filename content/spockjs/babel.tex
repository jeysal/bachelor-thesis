\section{Babel}
Babel is a popular community-developed JavaScript compiler
that is used and sponsored by many of the most prominent tech companies
and has acquired more than 28000 stars on GitHub as of mid-July 2018.

Started as `6to5', serving the purpose of transforming
ECMAScript 2015 (at that time named ECMAScript 6) code to
ECMAScript 5 code that would run in all browsers and on all platforms
regardless of their ECMAScript 2015 support,
Babel can now not only transform input code using
more recent versions of ECMAScript such as ECMAScript 2018
and even ES.Next proposals that are not yet in the standard,
but also apply arbitrary plugins developed by the community
that can transform the code to their liking.

In the following, we will acquire some basic knowledge on how to develop Babel plugins.
For a more extensive and detailed view that would go beyond the scope of this paper,
both the author and the official Babel documentation recommend the Babel Plugin Handbook.
