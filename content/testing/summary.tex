\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we have learned what test oracles are
and we have seen how they are commonly manifested in assertions.
We have also illustrated the use of test drivers and stubs in component testing
and distinguished mocks from stubs.

In the following chapter,
we will take a look at how the Spock Framework
implements assertions and mocking, including stubbing.
