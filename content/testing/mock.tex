\section{Mocks}
There is no clear consensus on the meaning and differentiation
of the terms `stub' and `mock', however, a common definition
--- and the one that we will use ---
is that mocks extend stubs to
not only answer to calls with predefined responses,
but also to place equally predefinable assertions on
the calls that the test subjects performs on the mock,
\autocite{MocksArentStubs}
thus becoming part of the test oracle.
Many mocking libraries choose to
not make a distinction at all in practice
and have their mock objects act as
dummies, fakes, stubs, spies and mocks
--- however those may be distinguished --- at once.
