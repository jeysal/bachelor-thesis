\section{Test oracles}
\textit{Test oracles} are the part of a test
that determines whether the test
has failed or succeeded.
\autocite{HowdenTesting}
In xUnit frameworks (such as xUnit.net, JUnit, and many more),
they are typically encoded as \textit{assertions}.
\autocite{MeszarosXUnit}
There, they most commonly occur in test case bodies,
but may also appear in other parts of the xUnit test structure,
such as test fixture teardown functions
to share an assertion across an entire test suite.

Assertions verify that a logical expression,
which is expected to be an \textit{invariant}
at that point in the program,
is indeed truthy during execution.
If it is not,
the assertion will cause the test to fail,
usually by interrupting the control flow
by means of throwing an exception:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
assert(1 === 1); // assert(invariant) is no-op
assert(1 === 2); // throws an exception
assert(2 === 2); // never executed
\end{minted}
