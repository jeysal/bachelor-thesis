\chapter{Automated software testing}
Many software projects these days
strive to automate as much of the
software verification work as possible.
In particular, dynamic testing
is a popular method to verify
that the software fulfills
its functional requirements.
A wide variety of test runners,
frameworks and support libraries are
available and used to optimize
the test creation workflow,
and the wider project infrastructure
is adapted to execute automated tests frequently
within continuous integration pipelines.
