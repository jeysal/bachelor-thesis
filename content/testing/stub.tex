\section{Test stubs}
\textit{Test stubs} are the inverse counterpart to test drivers.
They replace components that the test subject depends on
and provide canned answers to calls from the test subject to the stubbed component.
\autocite{MocksArentStubs}
They are particularly useful in top-down software development,
where the high-level components are implemented first
and testing them requires stubs for their dependencies
that are not yet implemented in full detail.
