\section{Assertion helpers}
Many programming languages and standard libraries
natively provide a mechanism for assertions
in tests or sometimes even in production code
through syntax features, such as Python's \code{assert} statement,
\autocite[Chapter 7.3: The assert statement]{pythonLangRef}
or through functions, such as Node.js' \code{assert} module.
\autocite[Chapter: Assert]{nodejsDoc}

In addition to those typically rather primitive helpers,
there are many third-party libraries capable of
intuitively performing more complex or specific assertions,
as demonstrated by this \textit{Chai} snippet:
\autocite[Chapter: API Reference --- Language Chains --- .not]{chaiBddDoc}
\begin{minted}{javascript}
expect([1, 2]).to.be.an('array').that.does.not.include(3);
\end{minted}
Examples include asserting
\autocite{chaiBddDoc}\autocite{javaHamcrestJavadoc}
\begin{itemize}
  \item deep equality,
  \item regular expression matches,
  \item emptiness of a collection, and
  \item occurrence in a collection,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item optionally in a specific order.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
