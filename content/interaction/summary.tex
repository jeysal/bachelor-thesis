\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we defined the scope
of the interaction testing capabilities
that we want to add to spockjs
and presented the concrete syntax for them.

We explained why and how users should be able
to choose their preferred mocking library
to use in conjunction with spockjs and
presented two ways to implement the interaction testing capabilities
while preserving that choice for our users.

We will go both of those ways in the following chapters
in order to compare them afterwards.
The interaction parser and
the integration into the spockjs Babel plugin
constitute the portion of the code
that is common to both approaches.
In this chapter, we also implemented that common portion already.
