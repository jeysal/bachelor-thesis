\chapter{Making interactions work}\label{chap:Interaction}
Like the assertion block DSL, our interaction block DSL
will be heavily inspired by the Spock Framework.
However, we will only design and start implementing a subset of
its capabilities in this chapter and in the scope of this paper,
restraining ourselves to the simplest mock and stub interactions
and the combination of those two in one interaction.
