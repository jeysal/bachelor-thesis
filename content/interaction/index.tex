\chapter{Making interactions work}
Like the assertion block DSL, our interaction block DSL
will be heavily inspired by the Spock Framework.
However, we will only implement a subset of
its capabilities in the scope of this paper,
restraining ourselves to the simplest mock and stub interactions
and the combination of those two in one interaction.
