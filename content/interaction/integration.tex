\section{Integration}
In its top-level \textit{index.ts} file,
our new \textit{@spockjs/interaction-block} package
exports a function with the signature:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{typescript}
(t, config) => ({
  declare: (statementPath: NodePath<BabelTypes.Statement>) => void,
  verify: (statementPath: NodePath<BabelTypes.Statement>) => void,
});
\end{minted}

This signature is reminiscent of \textit{@spockjs/assertion-block} (`assertifyStatement'),
because it, too, performs the task of transforming a declarative block into
something that actually executes meaningful code.
However, this package can transform two distinct types of blocks
--- interaction declaration and interaction verification blocks ---
so after applying the \code{t} and \code{config} arguments
that do not change throughout the compilation,
there are both the \textit{declare} and the \textit{verify} function available
to be applied to individual blocks with the
respective labels \textit{mock/stub} and \textit{verify},
which are also exported by the package as
\textit{declarationLabels} and \textit{verificationLabel}.

To integrate the new interaction block transformation package into the
central \textit{@spockjs/babel-plugin-spock} Babel plugin package
--- similarly to the assertion block transformation package ---
we first import all of its exported values:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{typescript}
import transformInteractionDeclarationStatement, {
  declarationLabels as interactionDeclarationLabels,
  verificationLabel as interactionVerificationLabel,
} from '@spockjs/interaction-block';
\end{minted}
Then, we add if statements that handle the new block types
right below the assertion block handling
(after line 51 in the plugin source code that was
previously shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BabelPluginSpockBefore}):
\begin{minted}[linenos,fontsize=\scriptsize]{typescript}
// interaction block
else if (interactionDeclarationLabels.includes(label)) {
  transformLabeledBlockOrSingle(
    transformInteractionDeclarationStatement(babel.types, config).declare,
    path,
  );
} else if (label === interactionVerificationLabel) {
  transformLabeledBlockOrSingle(
    transformInteractionDeclarationStatement(babel.types, config).verify,
    path,
  );
}
\end{minted}
