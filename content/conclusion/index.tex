\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:Conclusion}
Having implemented both
the \textit{direct compilation} approach and
the \textit{runtime dispatch} approach to
building an abstraction for interaction block handling
over multiple mocking libraries,
we now have a sufficiently concrete view on
how their implementations differ in detail
to compare the approaches directly.
In the following, we compare
the slighty less obvious and intuitive runtime dispatch approach
to the direct compilation approach.
