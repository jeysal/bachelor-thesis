\section{Runtime dispatch: The good}
TODO way better dev experience, incl. e.g. type checking
TODO   with stuff like Jest, this is *really* bad, need lots of complex logic
TODO   loops for implementing cardinality, ... scary
TODO   desired future features might add way more complexity: ordered mock expectations, improved error messages (eww nested template strings)
TODO   easier to write code *well*, e.g. proper usage of symbols -> can easily hold global state in the module, otherwise only per file and even that only with annoying Babel scope management to generate the code safely
TODO   workaround might be possible: put it into extra file, parse it as function, print it and call it with the substitutions as arguments. at that point, might as well use runtime dispatch...
