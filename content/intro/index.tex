\chapter{Introduction}
In software development, automated tests are one of the key tools
to achieve a high level of software quality.
Writing tests efficiently itself requires good support
from the programming language, standard library, or third party tools.
We will take a look at two types of testing tools:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{assertion libraries} and
  \item \textit{stubbing / mocking libraries}.
\end{itemize}
Both can be standalone or part of a greater testing framework or utility library.
The former are used to specify a part of the \textit{test oracle},
deciding whether a test case is considered to pass successfully or fail with an error.
The latter are particularly important for substituting subsystems in component testing,
and mock expectations can also form another part of the test oracle.
