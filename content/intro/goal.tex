\section{Goal}
Our goal is to complement the existing spockjs functionality
with basic support for Spock-style interaction testing.
In addition to preserving the property of test runner-agnosticism,
the interaction testing implementation shall also be
agnostic of the mocking library in use ---
unlike the original Spock, which ships with its own mock object implementation.
This design provides the benefits
\begin{itemize}
  \item that users can still access specific features
    of their library of choice past spockjs,
    in particular features that integrate well with
    their test runner and other tools, and
  \item that users can choose to quit using spockjs at any time
    and even use an automated escape hatch to return to using their library directly,
    like it is already possible with assertions in spockjs,
    thus avoiding a form of `technology lock-in'.
\end{itemize}

To achieve this kind of flexibility,
we experiment with and evaluate two different approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Immediately compiling the interaction declarations
    to calls to the target mocking library, and
  \item compiling the interaction declarations
    to calls to our own uniform interface
    while providing implementations
    of that interface
    for each target mocking library.
\end{enumerate}
Because a comparison uncovering advantages and disadvantages of these two architectures
as well as techniques to tame their individual challenges
may also be valuable for the implementation of other DSLs
using the custom compilation approach,
we make highlighting those discoveries an explicit goal of ours too.
% TODO get back to this, what are our discoveries?
