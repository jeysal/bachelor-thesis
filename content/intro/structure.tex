\section{Structure}
In the following Chapter~\ref{chap:Testing},
we will highlight the aspects of automated software testing
that our later work will touch on,
including test assertions, stubs and mocks.

Afterwards, in Chapter~\ref{chap:Spock},
we will take a closer look at the implementation of DSLs in general
and at the DSL of the Spock Framework in particular.

To explain the very foundation of how the Spock Framework
manages to implement its DSL,
we will work out the basics of
syntax tree traversal and transformation
in Chapter~\ref{chap:Ast}.
