\chapter{Runtime dispatch}
In this chapter,
we will develop alternative implementations
of interaction blocks
for the Sinon.JS and Jest mocking libraries
as well as their integration into the Babel plugin
in the \textit{@spockjs/interaction-block} package.
Unlike the direct compilation method,
interaction blocks always compile to the same calls,
but the callee is a runtime adapter
imported from a different package
depending on which mocking library
calls should be delegated to.
Direct comparisons between this approach
and the direct compilation approach
are saved for the following chapter;
this chapter merely describes the approach
without evaluating it.
