\section{Summary}
In this chapter,
we implemented interaction block handling
using our second approach,
in which the generated code does not depend
on the mocking library in use,
expect for the runtime adapter
handling the interaction declarations and verifications,
which can be swapped to use different mocking libraries.

The library-independent part did a lot more work with this approach,
but in turn, developing individual library adapters became easier.
Adding to that, much of the library-specific code from the first approach
could be reused with slight modifications.
