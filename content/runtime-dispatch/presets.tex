\section{Presets}
With the runtime dispatch approach,
mocking library presets
each have to export the module name of an
\textit{interactionRuntimeAdapter}.
When interaction blocks are used,
this module name will be used as the source
for importing the adapter that accepts
the generated declaration and verification calls.

An interaction runtime adapter exports
the \textit{declare} and \textit{verify}
functions with the following type signatures:
\begin{minted}{typescript}
let declare: (
  declaration: RuntimeInteractionDeclaration,
) => void;
let verify: (
  mockObject: any
) => void;
\end{minted}
Note that the \textit{RuntimeInteractionDeclaration} type
of the \textit{declare} parameter is not the same
as the \textit{InteractionDeclaration} type
that the declaration parser has as its output type,
which is called \textit{CompileTimeInteractionDeclaration}
with this approach because of this distinction.
Instead of the AST nodes of a
\textit{CompileTimeInteractionDeclaration}, a
\textit{RuntimeInteractionDeclaration} contains
the actual runtime values of an interaction declaration.
For example,
its \textit{cardinality} is of type \textit{number} instead of \textit{Expression}
and its \textit{mockObject} is of type \textit{any} instead of \textit{Expression}.

Of course, the Sinon.JS and Jest mocking library presets
do not contain the corresponding interaction processors themselves
with this approach either.
The \textit{interactionRuntimeAdapter} module names they export
are those of the interaction runtime adapter packages
\textit{@spockjs/interaction-runtime-adapter-sinon} and
\textit{@spockjs/interaction-runtime-adapter-jest}.
