\chapter{The Spock Framework}\label{chap:Spock}
The Spock Framework is a testing framework for the Groovy programming language
and other languages that run on the \textit{Java Virtual Machine (JVM)}.
\autocite{SpockFrameworkDoc}
It is one of the most used testing tools in the Groovy ecosystem.
\autocite[Chapter 3.6: Testing Guide]{GroovyDoc}
Its most remarkable feature is the concise and expressive,
but somewhat unusual DSL for writing tests.
