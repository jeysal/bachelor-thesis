\section{Summary}
In this chapter,
we have examined the Spock Framework
with regard to its testing DSL.
We looked at how it can help structure your test cases well,
how it implements assertions and data-driven testing,
and in particular its interaction testing capabilities,
which will serve as a starting point for
designing and implementing similar features for spockjs.

We have also identified it as a DSL that is implemented via custom compilation
and looked at the specific characteristics and advantages of this implementation concept
for a testing language like the one Spock provides and the one that we will develop.
