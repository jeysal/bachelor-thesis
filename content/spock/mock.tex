\section{Interaction testing}
The Spock Framework comes with an own library
for creating test mocks
(which are at the same time also test stubs).
While it is possible to use any such library
written in Java or another language
that can be compiled to JVM bytecode
in conjunction with the Spock Framework,
only mock objects created using Spock
can be used with its special syntax
for declaring mock interactions.
Mock objects can be created in the following two equivalent ways:
\autocite[Chapter: Interaction Based Testing - Creating Mock Objects]{SpockFrameworkDoc}
\begin{minted}{groovy}
Subscriber subscriber0 = Mock()
final subscriber1 = Mock(Subscriber)
\end{minted}
