\section{Summary}
In this chapter,
we implemented interaction block handling
with the backing mocking libraries Sinon and Jest
using the first of our two conceived approaches.

With this approach,
library-specific \textit{interaction processors} do most of the work,
using \textit{babel-template},
which we also learned about in this chapter,
to generate chunks of code
that call APIs provided by the mocking library
and optionally performing arbitrary additional computations,
such as in the case of Jest.
