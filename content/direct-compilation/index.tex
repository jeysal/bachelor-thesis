\chapter{Direct compilation}\label{chap:DirectCompilation}
In this chapter, we will develop
two \textit{interaction processors}
that implement interaction blocks
for the Sinon.JS and Jest mocking libraries
to try out the direct compilation approach.
We will also finalize \textit{@spockjs/interaction-block} by adding code to
delegate to one of the interaction processors at compile time.
This chapter will not yet evaluate the approach;
evaluation is set aside until both approaches have been implemented.
