\chapter{Direct compilation}\label{chap:DirectCompilation}
In this chapter,
we will develop two interaction processors
that implement interaction blocks
for the Sinon.JS and Jest mocking libraries
to try out the direct compilation approach.
We will also finalize \textit{@spockjs/interaction-block} by adding code to
delegate to one of the interaction processors at compile time.
