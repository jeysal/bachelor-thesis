\section{Interaction processor integration}
We have created a parser for
interaction declaration blocks
in the previous chapter.
This parser already makes up the largest portion of the
\textit{@spockjs/interaction-block} package.
We can now implement the rest of the package.

The outer function shown below,
having received the Babel \textit{types} helper
and the spockjs configuration object in line 1,
extracts the interaction processors from the configuration
and prepares them for use in a \code{processors} array in lines 2 to 4.
It also validates that the config has at least one
primary interaction processor in lines 5 to 7
to make sure the user did not forget
to enable a preset for their mocking library:
\begin{minted}[linenos,fontsize=\scriptsize]{typescript}
export default (t: typeof BabelTypes, config: InternalConfig) => {
  const processors = config.hooks.interactionProcessors.map(processor =>
    processor(t, config),
  );
  if (!processors.some(({ primary }) => primary)) {
    throw new Error(/* ... */);
  }

  return {
    declare, // ...
    verify, // ...
  }
}
\end{minted}

Because there may be auxiliary interaction processors
in addition to the single usual primary processor,
we allow the configured presets to specify an array
of more than one interaction processor.
All specified interaction processors
will be applied to interaction declarations and verifications
and all of the AST nodes they generate will be inserted sequentially.

The \textit{declare} function as shown below
first ensures that the interaction declaration block
has the expected structure of a binary expression statement
in lines 2 to 7.
If it does, in line 8 the parser is called
to obtain the interaction declaration,
which is then passed to every
interaction processor in line 10.
The collective statement nodes returned from
the declaration functions of the processors
are used to replace the interaction declaration block
in lines 9 to 11.
The following code shows the \textit{declare} function implementation,
eliding error case handling:
\begin{minted}[linenos,fontsize=\scriptsize]{typescript}
(statementPath: NodePath<BabelTypes.Statement>) => {
  if (statementPath.isExpressionStatement()) {
    const expressionPath = statementPath.get('expression') as NodePath<
      BabelTypes.Expression
    >;

    if (expressionPath.isBinaryExpression()) {
      const declaration = parseInteractionDeclaration(expressionPath);
      statementPath.replaceWithMultiple(
        processors.map(({ declare }) => declare(declaration)),
      );
    }
  }
}
\end{minted}

Even more simply,
the \textit{verify} function just replaces the interaction verification block
with the collective statement nodes returned from
the verification functions of the processors
applied to the mock object expression:
\begin{minted}[linenos,fontsize=\scriptsize]{typescript}
(statementPath: NodePath<BabelTypes.Statement>) => {
  if (statementPath.isExpressionStatement()) {
    statementPath.replaceWithMultiple(
      processors.map(({ verify }) => verify(statementPath.node.expression)),
    );
  }
}
\end{minted}
