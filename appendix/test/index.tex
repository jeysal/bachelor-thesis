\section*{Test cases}
This section lists the test cases that
an interaction block implementation needs to pass.
This encompasses
\begin{itemize}
  \item test cases with the preset for Jest mocks enabled,
  \item test cases with the preset for Sinon.JS mocks enabled, and
  \item common test cases for invalid interaction blocks.
\end{itemize}

Each test case
--- apart from those for invalid blocks ---
specifies the code that is transformed,
and the result of executing the transformed code:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Its return value,
  \item that it throws (with a sensible error message), or
  \item that it does not throw.
\end{itemize}
